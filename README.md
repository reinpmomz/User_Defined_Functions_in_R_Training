# User Defined Functions in R Training
This repo contains all the materials used during the **Platform and Harmonization/FAIR Working Group training** on **Thursday 21 November 2024**.

## Introduction

This training is aimed at equipping Pathfinders in **Data Science without borders** Project with the needed **hands-on** skills to utilize **user defined functions** to help in implementation of reproducible analysis pipeline. 

## Requirements and setup

- Sign up for [Github](https://github.com/) account (If you don't have one).
- We are assuming you have `R Software` and `Rstudio IDE` installed. If not you can download and install [**R software**](https://www.r-project.org/) then followed by [**RStudio/Posit IDE**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

## Outline of Presentation

- Introduction
	- Definition of a function
	- Why create functions
	- Types of functions
- Built-in Functions in R
- Creating Functions in R
	- Structure/Components
	- Guiding principles
- Calling Functions in R
- Nested Functions/Functions inside other Functions
- Practicals in R/Rstudio
  - Demo of User defined functions
  
### User Defined functions

Some of the developed user defined functions are useful in:
- **generating presentable descriptive/inferential tables:** `helperfuns_gt_summary_themes.R`, `helperfuns_table_summary_categorical.R`
- **visualization plots (bar graphs, histograms, boxplots, stacked plots, line plots):** `helperfuns_ggplot_themes.R`, `helperfuns_simple_plots.R`, `helperfuns_stack_plots.R`, `helperfuns_grouped_line_plots.R`

## Run

After cloning the repository or downloading the ZIP, Open `main.Rmd` and run from the beginning.
